## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### 1. Secret Management
```bash
# ✅ Use environment variables
export SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
export JWT_SECRET_KEY='your-jwt-secret'

# ❌ Don't put secrets in code
app.secret_key = 'hardcoded-secret'  # Very bad!
```

#### 2. Input Validation
```python
# ✅ Always validate and sanitize
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

filename = secure_filename(file.filename)

# ❌ Never trust inputs
filename = file.filename  # Dangerous!
```

#### 3. Database Queries
```python
# ✅ Use Parameterized Queries
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?", (username,))

# ❌ Don't use String Concatenation
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{username}'"  # SQL Injection!
```

#### 4. Authentication & Authorization
```python
# ✅ Protect sensitive routes
@app.route('/admin')
@login_required
@admin_required
def admin_panel():
    pass

# ❌ Don't leave sensitive routes open
@app.route('/admin')
def admin_panel():
    pass  # Anyone can access!
```

### For Users

#### 1. Strong Passwords
- ✅ Use complex passwords (12+ characters)
- ✅ Change default password immediately
- ✅ Use a password manager

#### 2. System Updates
```bash
# Check for updates regularly
git pull origin main
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

#### 3. Production Settings
```bash
# In production
DEBUG=False
FLASK_ENV=production

# Use HTTPS
# Enable CORS carefully
# Limit uploaded file sizes
```

#### 4. Backups
```bash
# Backup database regularly
cp data/detections.db backups/detections_$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```
